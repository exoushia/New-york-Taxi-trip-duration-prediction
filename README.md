Ml problem from Datahack:

To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict 
how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be 
ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.

EDA + Feature transformations + prediction
